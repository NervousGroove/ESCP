# üêä ESCP
ESCP or also known in a more complex form, called Export Settings and Compatibility Parameters is a library created specifically for MythCoder and SpellSpike. ESCP is written in JavaScript and TypeScript, with the goal of implementing and configuring SpellSpike in MythCoder. MythCoder is the only official and recommended IDE for programming in SpellSpike, and it is not without reason that we created a library just to implement our language in it. SpellSpike is a high level SwankyNoob language that is extremely easy, fast, broad, and safe, but inside (for the maintenance/creation of it), it is complex. To implement it in MythCoder required all these scripts from this repository, and they are present in MythCoder. Although it is included in both, ESCP is neither part of MythCoder nor SpellSpike, it is outside of it, but has the same CC-NC-ND 4.0 license. The goal of ESCP is to make the IDE/Compiler (MythCoder) understand the SpellSpike language and export SpellSpike projects. Besides having this major goal of "translating" the language, ESCP is designed to configure the export of SpellSpike projects. The ESCP creates all the necessary SpellSpike files, and makes an adaptation and conversion of them, adding the user code and configuring the whole recognition process, so that the machine understands the language and the ".spike" extension.

# üêâ License
As mentioned before, ESCP is under CC-NC-ND 4.0 license, the same license as MythCoder and SpellSpike.

# ü•Ç Use for personal development
The license (CC-NC-ND) makes it impossible for you to distribute any software, app or game containing ESCP, but unlike MythCoder and SpellSpike, its source code is free FOR STUDY (ONLY).

# üëæ Constantly Improving
ESCP (Export Settings and Compatibility Parameters) is constantly improving, constantly updating, receiving new features, fixes and changes.
